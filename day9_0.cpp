// Inheritance in C++
// The capability of a class to derive properties and characteristics from another class is called Inheritance. 

// Types of Inheritance

// Single inheritance is a type of inheritance in which a derived class is inherited with only one base class.

// Multiple inheritances are a type of inheritance in which one derived class is inherited with more than one base class

// A hierarchical inheritance is a type of inheritance in which several derived classes are inherited from a single base class

// Multilevel inheritance is a type of inheritance in which one derived class is inherited from another derived class

// Hybrid inheritance is a combination of multiple inheritance and multilevel inheritance. In hybrid inheritance, a class is
// derived from two classes as in multiple inheritances. However, one of the parent classes is not a base class.
