// inline function
/* C++ provides an inline functions to reduce the function call
 overhead. Inline function is a function that is expanded in line
 when it is called. When the inline function is called whole code
  of the inline function gets inserted or substituted at the point
  of inline function call. This substitution is performed by the
   C++ compiler at compile time
*/
inline void func(int a, int b){
    cout << a + b << endl;
}
// usually if the code in function is small only then inline
// functions are used, so as to increase speed bcoz it takes a lot of memory
// to declare a function as inline if code inside function defination is big.
/* Remember, inlining is only a request to the compiler, not a
command. Compiler can ignore the request for inlining.
Compiler may not perform inlining in such circumstances like:
1) If a function contains a loop. (for, while, do-while)
2) If a function contains static variables.
3) If a function is recursive.
4) If a function return type is other than void, and the return statement doesnâ€™t exist in function body.
5) If a function contains switch or goto statement.*/
